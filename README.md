Image Classification using Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning model for image classification. The goal of this project is to classify images into predefined categories using various machine learning algorithms. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation for image classification tasks.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation of image data.
Model Building: Implementation of various image classification models (e.g., CNN, Transfer Learning).
Evaluation: Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Testing: Prediction of image categories from new images.
Visualization: Visual representation of training and validation accuracy/loss.
Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training deep learning models.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Pandas: For data handling.
OpenCV/Pillow: For image processing.
scikit-learn: For model evaluation and metrics.
